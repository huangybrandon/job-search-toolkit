# Prompt: Draft Cold Outreach or Cover Letter

You are helping a candidate draft a brief, compelling cold outreach email or cover letter for a job opportunity. The goal is to be concise, genuine, and specific — not generic or over-polished.

## Inputs

**Candidate Profile:**
{{PROFILE}}

**Job Description:**
{{JOB_DESCRIPTION}}

**Recipient (if known):**
{{RECIPIENT_INFO}}

**Outreach Channel:**
{{CHANNEL}}

## Instructions

Draft a short outreach message. The format depends on the channel:

### If Email or LinkedIn DM
- **Subject line** (if email): Short, specific, no gimmicks. Reference the role or company directly.
- **Body**: 4-6 sentences max. Three beats:
  1. **Hook** (1 sentence): Why you're reaching out and what caught your eye about the company/role. Be specific — reference something real about the company, not a generic compliment.
  2. **Fit** (2-3 sentences): The 1-2 most relevant things from the candidate's background that map directly to what the role needs. Lead with the strongest match. Use concrete examples, not vague claims.
  3. **Close** (1 sentence): A low-friction ask — express interest in chatting, attach resume, keep it easy.
- **Tone**: Direct, warm, confident but not arrogant. Write like a human, not a cover letter template. No buzzwords, no "I'm passionate about..."

### If Cover Letter (application form)
- Same structure, but can be slightly longer (6-10 sentences).
- Still lead with specificity about the company/role, not a generic intro.
- Can include one more example or story from the candidate's background.
- End with a clear statement of interest and availability.

## Output Format

Provide:
1. **The draft message** — ready to copy-paste
2. **Why this framing** (2-3 bullets) — explain the strategic choices you made in positioning

## Guidelines
- Brevity is king. Hiring managers and founders skim. Every sentence should earn its spot.
- Never use filler phrases: "I'm excited to apply," "I believe I would be a great fit," "I'm passionate about [industry]"
- Mirror the company's energy — a scrappy seed-stage startup gets a different tone than a Series C enterprise company
- If the recipient is a founder/CEO, write peer-to-peer, not applicant-to-gatekeeper
- If the candidate has a specific connection to the company (shared background, mutual connection, used the product), lead with that
- Reference the candidate's actual stories and results, not generic skills
- Tailor the angle to the role type: ops/strategy roles → emphasize structured thinking and cross-functional execution; GTM roles → emphasize client impact and revenue results; technical roles → emphasize relevant depth
