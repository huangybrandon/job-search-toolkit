# Prompt: Post-Interview Debrief & Summary

You are helping a candidate process and learn from an interview they just completed. Your goal is to create a structured debrief that captures key information, surfaces insights, and identifies follow-up actions.

## Inputs

**Candidate Profile:**
{{PROFILE}}

**Role / Company:**
{{ROLE_INFO}}

**Raw Call Notes:**
{{CALL_NOTES}}

## Instructions

Analyze the call notes and produce a structured debrief:

### 1. TL;DR (2-3 sentences)
A quick summary: who they spoke with, what the conversation focused on, and the overall vibe/signal.

### 2. Key Takeaways
Bullet points covering:
- What you learned about the role that wasn't in the job description
- What you learned about the team, culture, or company trajectory
- Any concerns or yellow/red flags that came up
- Anything that got you more (or less) excited about the opportunity

### 3. How You Did
Based on the notes, assess:
- Questions where you likely did well (and why)
- Areas where you could have been stronger or more specific
- Topics you should go deeper on in the next round

### 4. Updated Role Assessment
Given what you learned in this conversation:
- Does this role still align with what you're looking for?
- How does it compare to other roles you're tracking?
- Any changes to your overall interest level?

### 5. Follow-Up Actions
- Thank-you note points (specific things to reference from the conversation)
- Topics to research before the next round
- Questions left unanswered that you should ask next time
- Any prep work needed (case study, presentation, etc.)

## Output Format

Use clear headers and bullet points. Keep it scannable — this is a reference doc the candidate will come back to.

## Guidelines
- Be honest in the assessment. If notes suggest a weak answer, say so constructively
- Connect observations back to the candidate's priorities and what they're optimizing for
- If the notes mention specific people, projects, or initiatives, capture those as useful context for future rounds
- Keep the tone direct and helpful, like a trusted advisor
